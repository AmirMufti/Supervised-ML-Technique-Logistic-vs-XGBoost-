# Waze-User-Churn-Project
Introduction and Background 
We downloaded a dataset on Waze app users' activities, a fictional transportation company from Kaggle. The dataset contained the following columns, 
•	ID (unique ID for each customer)
•	Label (retained or churned)
•	Sessions (number of times the user logged in to the app)
•	Drives (number of times the user drove the vehicle)
•	total_sessions (total number of times the user logged in to the app since its installation)
•	n_days_after_onboarding (number of days since the user first logged in to the app)
•	total_navigations_fav1 (number of sessions/visits to favorite place 1)
•	total_navigations_fav2 (number of sessions/visits to favorite place 2)
•	driven_km_drives (kilometers driven so far)
•	duration_minutes_drives (minutes the vehicle was drove)
Goal: This model aims to find factors that drive user churn and to predict whether a Waze user is retained or churned.
This analysis will help Waze's initiative to enhance growth. High retention rates usually indicate satisfied users who consistently use the app over time. By developing a churn prediction model, we aim to prevent user churn, improve retention, and support Waze's business growth. 
Key Questions
1.	What is the current churn rate?
2.	How many users are actively using the app?
3.	How much time does an average user spend on the app?
4.	Who are the most at-risk users?
5.	How can we prevent user churn?
6.	How will project success be measured?
